            <h1>The Swamp Phantom</h1>
            <p>
                Tito led the way, his powerful legs propelling him through the water with ease. Fletch zipped alongside him, while Willa stayed hidden, her eyes scanning for any signs of danger.

                As they approached the old well, a sinister figure emerged from the shadows. It was the Swamp Phantom, a malevolent spirit that had long been trapped within the well’s dark depths.
                <br><br> Now free, it sought to spread its icy grip across the entire swamp, freezing everything in its path.

                The Swamp Phantom cackled as it saw the Supertoad Trio approaching. "Foolish toads! You think you can stop me? I’ll turn this swamp into a frozen wasteland!"

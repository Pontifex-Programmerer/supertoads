            <h1>Supertoad Trio</h1>
            <p>
                In a quiet, unassuming swamp at the edge of a dense forest, three ordinary-looking toads lived. Their names were Tito, Fletch, and Willa. They spent their days basking in the sun, catching flies, and hopping from lily pad to lily pad. But what the other creatures of the swamp didn’t know was that these three toads weren’t just any toads—they were the Supertoad Trio, protectors of the swamp, each with their own unique superpower.

                Tito, the largest of the three, possessed the power of incredible strength. He could lift boulders, uproot trees, and leap vast distances in a single bound. Fletch, the smallest but the fastest, had the gift of speed. He could dart from one end of the swamp to the other in the blink of an eye, leaving only a ripple in the water as evidence of his passage. Willa, the wisest and most observant, had the ability to blend into her surroundings perfectly, becoming invisible to the naked eye. Together, they formed a formidable team.

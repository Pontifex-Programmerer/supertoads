            <h1>An emergency arises</h1>
            <p>

                One day, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the swamp began to glow with the soft light of fireflies, a disturbance rippled through the water. The normally serene swamp creatures were in a panic—something was wrong. The Supertoad Trio gathered at their usual meeting spot, a large flat rock in the center of the swamp, to investigate.

                "The water feels strange," croaked Tito, dipping one of his powerful legs into the murky depths. "It’s colder than usual."

                Fletch zipped back and forth across the swamp, his eyes wide with concern. "And the fish are swimming in circles, as if they’re confused. Something’s definitely wrong."

                Willa, perched on a nearby cattail, closed her eyes and concentrated. Her skin slowly faded, matching the colors of the swamp around her, until she was nearly invisible. "There’s a dark presence in the water," she said quietly, her voice barely audible. "It’s coming from the old well at the edge of the swamp."

                Without hesitation, the Supertoad Trio sprang into action.
